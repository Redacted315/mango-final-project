## Important Notes

### About Reviewer Assignments

**Reviewers will be randomly assigned by the instructor on December 5.**

- You will NOT know who reviews your code until Part 1 is submitted
- Random assignment prevents coordination between developer and reviewer
- Ensures fair, independent reviews
- Each student reviews ONE other component (not their own)

### Component Difficulty Guide

- **Component 1 (Student Class):** Beginner - Good starting point, needed by others
- **Component 2 (StudentManager):** Intermediate - File I/O and CRUD operations
- **Component 3 (Course + CourseManager):** Intermediate - Two files, similar to 1 & 2
- **Component 4 (EnrollmentManager):** Advanced - Most complex, needs validation
- **Component 5 (Main Application):** Advanced - Integration lead, menu system

### Timeline Reminder

- **Today:** Choose components, submit this form
- **Nov 25 - Dec 4:** Build your component
- **Dec 4 (Thursday class):** Bring completed component to class
- **Dec 6 (Saturday):** Submit Part 1 to Brightspace (integrated code)
- **Dec 5:** Instructor announces random review assignments
- **Dec 5-11:** Conduct peer reviews, fix issues, integrate
- **Dec 11 (Thursday class):** Present working system
